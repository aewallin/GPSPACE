Update 2021 June:
a new file IGRF13.F is available from https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html

For GPSPACE this could would need to be modified into the same format as IGRF12.F
providing a igrf12syn() subroutine.

The source files in this directory were downloaded from the IGRF web site:
        https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html

Original directory contains the original igrf12.f program and the current
(IGRF) directory contains a modification of that file, converting it to a
subroutine usable in GPSPACE.

Subroutine igrf12syn is called from iono2nd.f to compute 2nd and 3rd order
ionospheric effects.
